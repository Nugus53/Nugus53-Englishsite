<h1>Introduction </h1>
<p>As part of my English course and being a student in <a id="a">digital humanity<span>It is the study of the humanities through digital</span></a>.
I chose on this page to present my student project. It is a  <a id="a">mediation<span>it's making understands an element to a person. </span></a> tool to create digital paths. The project is called visio-tours and is currently in the design phase. A  <a id="a">prototype <span>A prototype is a final rendering of a project with the technology being tested.</span> </a>version will be available at the end of the school year

<h1> The Map </h1>

<p>
The visitor who wishes to discover the local <a id="a">heritage
<span>
Heritage is a fairly broad concept that brings together everything we inherit from the past. It can be material, such as immobilize them (monument), furniture (boats) or natural. But also immaterial as knowledge, tradition or language.
</span>
</a> 

 through routes proposed by cultural institutions.</p>

<p>The Visitor once the project chooses will have the possibility to choose a thematic path that he can
follow by clicking on buttons. It also has the means to follow it freely since each route
will display the travel points compose it in the same color. The vistors will be able in time with a
time slider.</p>

<h1>Points</h1>

<p>
The visitor can then click on the different type point.
Each time he will discover a different type of media.
In the protype version there will be 3 view type:

<a id="a">compared views <span>This view allows you to compare documents</spasn></a>, 
<a id="a">document wiews <span>This view allows you to simply view an old document related to the point of the map</spasn></a>, 
<a id="a">3d views <span>This view allows to visualize 3d objects and thus apprehend volumes</spasn></a>, 

in the future we hope to be able added other view type. Each time the media will be accompanied by annotated so that the visitor can understand what oberve.

<h1>Dynamic</h1>
<p>The sites will be dynamic, allowing each institution to add information as soon as it wishes. Avoid spending with each change made to the project. In the end the institution will be able to export its creation to import it on its own site. the site will benefit from an efficient moderation system in order to avoid abuse. It would also be possible to report content that respects</p>
